<h3> Topics to be covered, more or less.  Some will have been explored in Principles of Complex Systems (PoCS):</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
PoCS: Structure and form of complex networks 
including physical branching networks (river networks and cardiovascular networks), 
neural networks, social networks, the Internet, the world wide web, transportation 
networks, and organizations. 
</li>
<li>
PoCS: Properties of networks including degree distributions, clustering, motifs, various measures of 
betweenness, modularity, the role of randomness, network dynamics, and multiscale structures.
</li>
<li>
Real-world branching networks&mdash;rivers and blood; stream ordering, scaling, and self-similarity; Horton-Strahler laws; Tokunaga's law.
</li>
<li>
Quarterology: Connections between delivery networks, allometric scaling, energy usage, and more in organisms and cities.
