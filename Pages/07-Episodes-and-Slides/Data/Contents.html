<h2>Episodes:</h2><p>	All lectures are necessarily	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_episode">bottle</a>	<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode">episodes</a>;	we will occasionally overlay some 	<a href="http://tvtropes.org">other tropes</a>.</p>
<p>
	Slide sets are often spread over several episodes
	so below you will find separate, interconnected episode and slide lists
     (score: bipartite affiliation graph).
</p><p>	The slides are clickable pdf's, with links to relevant     articles and web pages, section links in the sidebar, and navigation icons at the bottom of each slide.  The reference section for each set of slides includes links to papers;superscript citation numbers link to the reference section as well(please let me know if any links or penguins behave badly).</p><p>Due to remorseless tinkering, the slides may change a littlefrom what was recorded.  Some video details:<ol><li>Screen capture and video creation is made possible by <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/">ScreenFlow</a>.</li><li>Possible implements include several iPod touches, the second generation Swivl thing, Garmin VIRB, Sennheiser wireless kit, and a Countryman microphone.</li><li>Episodes will be viewable in up to 1440HD (this likely needs to be selected manually after hitting play, via the little cog thing).</li><li>
For ease of retweeting, tweets announcing each episodes's coming into existence are embedded.</li><li>No comfy chairs will be used.</li></ol></p><p>To generate these lectures, I use the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)">beamer</a>LaTeX class,
XeLaTeX,<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/perltex/">PerlTeX</a>,and a selection of handcrafted, possibly dangerous Perl scripts.Because It Is Right, I follow the one true path of Emacs with an
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WJXHY2OXGE">almost fanatical devotion</a>.</p>Each set of slides comes in three delicious flavors:<br /><ul>
<li>The <b>lecture</b> pdf's include all the incremental reveals used in class.</li><li>The <b>slides</b> pdf's have flattened frames and arebetter for reading separately online. Use these if you follow the (terrifyingly long) videos andwant to click on things.</li><li>If you want a printed copy, possibly becausetrees upset you, the <b>handout</b> pdf'sprovide condensed and collapsed versions of the slides.These aren't very hyperlinky however (such is paper).</li></ul><hr />
